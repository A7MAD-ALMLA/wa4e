<h2>Setting up your PHP/MySql Devlopment Environment</h2>
<p>
In this page, you will install a programmer text editor, install a bundled all-in-one
PHP/MySql application, and explore that application briefly.
<p>
We have separate pages for each of the commonly used Operating Systems:
<ul>
<li><a href="software-win.php">Setting up the XAMPP PHP/MySql Environment in Microsoft Windows</a>
<li><a href="software-mac.php">Setting up the MAMP PHP/MySql Environment on a Macintosh</a> (suggested)
<li><a href="software-mac-xampp.php">Setting up the XAMPP PHP/MySql Environment on a Macintosh</a> (if you have problems with MAMP)
</ul>
<p>
You can use any software you like - I suggest XAMPP for Windows and MAMP for Macintosh because it seems as that these
install most reliably and with the least tweaking.
</p>
<p>
You will need 
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime" target=_new>QuickTime</a> 
(or iTunes)
installed on your computer to view any video materials or screencasts.
You should probably download the high quality copies of these
files or screencasts to your computer 
and view/play them 
locally.  They are rather large files and you will want to move 
back and forth as well as start and stop the podcasts so you can perform
the steps as indicated.
