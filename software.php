<h2>Setting up your PHP/MySql Devlopment Environment</h2>
<p>
In this page, you will install a programmer text editor, install a bundled all-in-one
PHP/MySql application, and explore that application briefly.
<p>
We have separate pages for each of the commonly used Operating Systems:
<ul>
<li><a href="software-win.php">Setting up the XAMPP PHP/MySql Environment in Microsoft Windows</a></li>
<li><a href="software-mac.php">Setting up the MAMP PHP/MySql Environment on a Macintosh</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can use any software you like - I suggest XAMPP for Windows and MAMP for 
Macintosh because it seems as that these
install most reliably and with the least tweaking.
