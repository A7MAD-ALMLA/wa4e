<h1>How images look </h2>
<p>
It is fun to float an image to the left or
right and watch the text wrap around it.
You might want to add a bit of margin so the text 
does not crowd it.  An <strong>em</strong> is the 
"height of the current font" so it scales when the size
of the font is changed.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
Sometimes we need to clear the "hanging wrap" 
when we want the next paragraph to go all the way
to the margin - in effect "clearing the float".
</p>
<p>
Images can be <img src="tiny.png"> right 
in the middle of text like a character.
Ad we can even make an image a clickable
<a href="lists.htm"><img src="tiny.png"></a>
link to another page.
