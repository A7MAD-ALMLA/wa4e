<h1>Hello World - index.htm</h1>
<p>
This is an HTML page. 
</p>
<pre>
Because it has a ".htm" suffix, 
the server simply reads it and sends 
the data stored in the file to your brower.

P.S. Check out the sweet pre tag - it respects 
newlines and      white      space.  It is great
for debugging PHP code.

<p>
Make sure to play with your browser's developer console.
